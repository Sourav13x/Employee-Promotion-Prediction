## Predict whether the Employee of an Organization should get Promotion or Not?</center>

&nbsp;
Our client is a large MNC and they have 9 broad verticals across the organisation. One of the problem our client is facing is around identifying the right people for promotion (only for manager position and below) and prepare them in time. Currently the process, they are following is:

    * First identify a set of employees based on recommendations/ past performance.
    
    * Selected employees go through the separate training and evaluation program for each vertical. These programs are based on the required skill of each vertical
    
    * At the end of the program, based on various factors such as training performance, an employee gets the promotion
    
-Used Logistic Regression of Machine Learning. Performed various machine learning concepts like Exploratory analysis, feature scaling,
 resampling along with Descriptive Statistics.
- Used Python Libraries Draw Pie chat, Box plot, Heat map, Bar plot and build a predictive system to predict promotion scenario of employee.
